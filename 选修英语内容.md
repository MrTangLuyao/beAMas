## **A SHORT HISTORY OF WESTERN PAINTNG**

**西方绘画艺术简史**

What is Western art? It is hard to give a precise definition. As there have been so many different styles of Western art, it is impossible to describe them all in a short text. Perhaps the best way to understand Western art is to look at the development of Western painting over the centuries.

什么是西方艺术?很难给出一个精确的定义。由于西方的艺术风格多种多样，在短短的一篇课文里不可能进行全面的描述。也许了解西方艺术的最好方法就是看看几个世纪以来西方绘画的发展。

The Middle Ages (from the 5th to the 15th century) 中世纪(5世纪到15世纪)

During the Middle Ages, the purpose of Western art was to teach people about Christianity. Thus, artists were not interested in painting **realistic** scenes. Their works were often **primitive** and two-dimensional, and the main characters were often made much larger than everyone else to show their importance. This began to change in the 13th century with Giotto di Bondone (1267-1337). While his paintings still had religious themes, they showed real people in a real environment. In particular, his paintings are set apart from other paintings by their realistic human faces and deep emotional impact.

在中世纪，西方艺术的目的是向人们传授基督教。因此，艺术家对写实场景不感兴趣。他们的作品通常较为粗糙且二维化，主体人物通常比其他人物大得多，以显示他们的重要性。这种情况在13世纪时因乔托・迪・邦多纳(1267-1337)而开始改变。尽管他的画仍然带有宗教主题，但它们展示的是真实的环境中的真实人物。尤其是他的画作，因其逼真的人物面貌和深刻的情感冲击而从其他画作中脱颖而出。

The Renaissance (from the 14th to the 17th century)文艺复兴时期(14世纪到17世纪)

New ideas and values gradually replaced old ones from the Middle Ages. As a result, painters concentrated less on religious themes. They began to adopt a more humanistic attitude to life. An important breakthrough during this period was the use of perspective by Masaccio(1401-1428) **Influential** painters such as Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519), Michelangelo (1475-1564) and Raphael (1483-1520) built upon Giotto and Masaccio's innovations to produce some of the greatest art that Europe had ever seen.

新的思想和价值观逐渐取代了中世纪的思想和价值观。因此，画家较少关注宗教主题。他们开始采取一种更人性化的生活态度。这一时期的个重要突破是马萨乔(1401-1428)对透视法的运用。一些颇具影响力的画家，例如昂纳多达芬・奇、米开朗琪罗和拉斐尔，在乔托和马萨乔的创新基础上继续发展，创造出欧洲前所未见的一些最伟大的艺术作品。

Another innovation was the use of oil paints. With their deep colours and realism, some of the best oil paintings look like photographs. While painters as early as Da Vinci had used oil, this technique reached its height with Rembrandt (1606-1669), who gained a **reputation** as a master of shadow and light

另一个创新是油画颜料的使用。由于其深沉的色彩和现实主义风格,一些最好的油画看上去就像是照片。尽管早在达芬・奇时代一些画家就使用油彩绘画，但伦勃朗使得这种技艺达到顶峰，他拥有“光影大师”的雅称。

In subject matter, the emphasis increasingly shifted from religious themes to people and the world around us. Kings, **nobles**, and people of high **rank** wanted to **purchase** accurate pictures of themselves and the people they loved. Others wanted paintings showing important historical events or stories from mythology. Finally, most **clients** wanted paintings that were beautiful and interesting to look at.

在题材上，重点逐渐从宗教主题转移到人和我们周围的世界。国王、贵族和上流社会人士都想购买自己和所爱之人的准确照片。其他人则想要展示重要历史事件或神话故事的画作。最后，大多数客户都想要看起来美丽有趣的画作。

Impressionism( late 19th to early 20th century) 印象派时期(19世纪后期到20世纪初期

The development of Western art slowed until the invention of photography in the mid-19th century. After that, paintings were no longer needed to preserve what people and the world looked like. Hence, painters had to find a new way of looking at their art. From this, Impressionism **emerged** in France. The name of this new movement came from the painting by Claude Monet 1840-1926) called *Impression*, *Sunrise*. In this work, Monets aim was to convey the light and movement in the scene—the **subjectiv**e impression the scene gave him—but not a detailed record of the scene itself.

直到19世纪中叶摄影术发明之前，西方艺术的发展缓慢。在那之后，不再需要绘画来保存人和世界的面貌了。因此，画家们不得不寻找一种新的方式来看待他们的艺术。由此，印象派在法国应运而生。这个新运动的名字来源于克劳德・莫奈(1840-1926)的一幅名为《印象日出》的画作。在这幅作品中，莫奈想传达场景中的光线和运动——场景给他的主观印象——而不是场景本身的详细记录。

While many Impressionists painted scenes of nature or daily life, others, such as Renoir (1841-1919), focused on people. Unlike the cold, black-and-white photographs of that time period, Renoirs paintings are full of light, shadow, colour, and life. He sought to show not just the outer image of his subjects, but their inner warmth and humanity as well.

虽然许多印象派画家描绘了自然或日常生活场景，但其他画家，如雷诺阿(1841-1919年)则以人物为关注对象。雷诺阿的画作与那个时代冷淡的黑白照片不同，充满了光、影、色彩和生命。他不仅试图展示他笔下人物的外在形象，而且还展示他们内心的温暖和人性。

Modern Art(from the 20th century to today)现代艺术(20世纪至今)

After Impressionism. **subsequent** artists began to ask. What do we do next? Painters such as Picasso (1881-1973) tried to analyse the shapes which existed in the natural world but in a new way, with Cubism. Others gave their paintings a realistic but dream-like quality. Still others turned to abstract art. What they attempted to do was no longer show reality, but instead to ask the question, "What is art?

在印象派之后，后来的艺术家开始问“下一步我们该做什么?” 像毕加索(1881-1973)这样的画家试图用一种新的方法——立体主义来分析自然界中存在的形状。其他人则赋予他们的画中一种写实但又像梦一样的品质特征。还有一些人转向抽象艺术。他们试图做的不再是展示现实，而是提出一个问题 “什么是艺术?”

## ANCIENT CHINNESEARTON SHOW

中国古代艺术展览

The Richfield Museum of Fine Art is proud to present our new **exhibition**, “From Shang to Qing: Chinese Art Through the Ages.” Join us as we explore more than 3,000 years of wonderful art from the Middle Kingdom. From bronze bowls to ceramic **vases**, and jade sculptures to ink wash paintings our goal is to display the Chinese artistic genius from ancient times

瑞奇菲尔德美术博物馆很荣幸地推出我们的新展览一从商到清:中国艺术千古流传”。加入我们，一起探索来自“中央王国” 3000多年的精彩纷呈的艺术吧。从青铜碗到陶瓷花瓶，从玉雕到水墨画，我们的目标是展示中国古代的艺术天赋。

The highlight of this exhibition is the painting Clearing After Snow on a Mountain Pass, one of the great works of Tang Yin (1470-1524). Born during the Ming Dynasty, Tang sought and failed to gain **entry** into the **civil** service, so he turned to painting instead. In time, he gained **recognition** as one of the greatest artists China has ever known. This painting, showing high mountains, trees, and houses covered in snow, was made with extraordinary skill. Though it is over 500 years old, it looks as fresh and full of life as the day it was created.

此次展览的重头戏是唐寅(1470-1524)的巨作之《函关雪霁图》。唐寅出生于明朝，但未能进入文职队伍，因此他转而从事绘画。随着时间的推移，他被公认为中国有史以来最伟大的艺术家之一。这幅画作运用非凡的技巧，展现了高山、树木和被雪覆盖的房屋。虽然它已经有500多年的历史了，但它看起来与它创建之日时一样清新、充满生机。

Also of primary note is a collection of nearly 100 bronze objects from the Shang Dynasty (1600 BCE-1046 BCE). While the artists who made these great works are not known, they showed great skill in creating these beautiful pieces. Some of the items on display are thought to have come from the collection of Emperor Qianlong(1711-1799), a great admirer of Shang Dynasty bronze

同样十分重要的(看点)是一组近百件商代(公元1600年—公元前1046年)青铜器品。虽然创作这些伟大作品的艺术家并不为人所知，但他们在创造这些精美作品时展现了高超的技巧。部分展品被认为是来自对商朝青铜器大为赞赏的乾隆皇帝(1711-1799年)的收藏品。

Finally, we have many fine examples of Tang Dynasty(618-907)sculptures. Most of these are of Buddhist origin. Even though Buddhism entered China much earlier, it did not really begin to show **expansion** until the seventh century. During this same period, trade along the Silk Road also boomed. Chinese sculpture thus found itself highly influenced by Buddhist art brought from India and Central Asia through the Silk Road. These works were intended to spread Buddhism and they are of exceptional beauty and quality. Looking at the faces of the figures in these sculptures, one sees the faces of the past. History is brought to life.

最后，我们有许多唐代(618-907)雕塑精品。其中大多数作品与佛教的起源有关。尽管佛教进入中国的时间要早得多，但直到公元7世纪才真正开始传播。在同一时期，丝绸之路的贸易也蓬勃发展。因此，中国雕塑受到通过丝绸之路从印度和中亚传来的佛教艺术的极大影啊。这些作品旨在传播佛教，具有非凡的美感和品质。看着这些雕塑中人物的面孔，您会看到过去时代的面孔，历史栩栩如生。

This is just a small taste of what is in store for you in this exhibition. We **guarantee** that "From Shang to Qing: Chinese Art Through the Ages" will transport you to another time with its amazing collection of works.

以上只是让你稍微感受下你将在本次展览看到什么。我们保证“从商到清:中国历代艺术”将以其惊人的收藏品将您带到另一个时代。

From Shang to Qing: Chinese Art Through the Ages " will run until November 25.

“从商到清: 中国历代艺术”将持续到11月25日。

Opening hours are from 9: 00 a.m. to 5: 00 p. m, from Tuesday to Sunday ( the museum is closed on Mondays). No one will be admitted into the exhibition after 4: 30 p. m.

开放时间为周二至周日上午九时至下午五时(博物馆逢星期一闭馆)。展览下午4:30后停止入馆。

Admission: \$10 for adults; \$8 for students; \$5 for children under 12; free for children under 5.

门票:成人10美元;学生8美元;十ニ岁以下的儿童5美元;5岁以下儿童免费入场。

No photos or food and drink are allowed in the museum.

## THE STARRY NIGHT

星夜

Perhaps my favourite painting is *The Starry Night*, by Vincent van Gogh(1853-1 890). Born in the Netherlands, Van Gogh had always been interested in art, and tried to live as a professional painter starting from 1883. His early work was dark and sad, so in 1886 Van Gogh's brother Theo invited him to come to live in Paris

也许我最喜欢的画是文森特-梵高（1853-1890）的《星夜》。梵高出生于荷兰，一直对艺术很感兴趣，从1883年开始尝试以职业画家的身份生活。他早期的作品是黑暗和悲伤的，所以1886年梵高的哥哥提奥邀请他来巴黎生活。

Theo hoped that the bright colours of the Impressionist movement there would influence his work. Van Gogh moved to the south of France in 1888. Later that year, he suffered a mental collapse and went to live in a hospital. He made more than twenty paintings of the view from his hospital window, during all times of the day and all kinds of weather. However, he only made one painting of the scene at night. As Van Gogh wrote to his brother Theo in June, 1889, “This morning I saw the countryside from my window a long time before sunrise, with nothing but the morning star, which looked very big.” The "morning star" Van Gogh referred to was actually the planet Venus. Van Gogh had longed to paint a night scene, and the sight of Venus inspired him

提奥希望那里的印象派运动的明亮色彩能影响他的作品。1888年，梵高搬到法国南部。同年晚些时候，他精神崩溃，住进了医院。他画了二十多幅画，画的都是医院窗外的景色，在一天中的任何时候，任何天气。然而，他只画了一幅夜景的画。正如梵高在1889年6月写给弟弟提奥的信中所说："今天早上，我在日出前很久就从窗口看到了乡村，除了晨星，什么都没有，晨星看起来非常大。" 梵高所说的 "晨星 "其实是金星。梵高一直渴望画一幅夜景，而金星的景象给了他灵感.

On the left side of *The Starry Night*, there is a large tree which shoots up from the ground like a dark fire. It reaches all the way to the top of the painting. In the background are rolling hills, with a small village in a valley. In the centre of the village is a white church. Its tower points up into the sky like a sharp knife. Here and there you can see houses with windows shining with yellow light. Above all this is dark blue sky. A quarter moon fills the top-right corner of the painting with yellow. Venus sits low near the tree. It burns with white light. Here and there in the sky above Venus are yellow, orange, and red stars. Around these are lines of pure paint in different shades of blue, yellow and white. They flow out of control, like river rapids.

在《星夜》的左侧，有一棵大树，它像一团黑火一样从地面射出。它一直延伸到画的顶端。背景是连绵起伏的群山，山谷里有一个小村庄。村子的中心是一座白色的教堂。它的塔楼像一把尖刀一样指向天空。在这里和那里，你可以看到房屋的窗户闪着黄色的光。在这一切之上，是深蓝色的天空。一轮四分之一的月亮在画的右上角充满了黄色。金星低低地坐在树旁。它燃烧着白色的光。在金星上方的天空中，这里和那里是黄色、橙色和红色的星星。在这些周围是蓝色、黄色和白色不同色调的纯颜料线条。它们不受控制地流动着，就像河流的激流。

*The Starry Night* is not a realistic panting of the scene Van Gogh saw out of his window. For example in real life there is no village in that valley. However, perhaps the painting shows the deeper reality of what Van Gogh could see with his mind's eye. Though the scene is dark and quiet, the painting is full of light and life. It gives us a look, perhaps, into the complex mind and genius of Van Gogh.

《星夜》并不是梵高看到的窗外的真实景象。比如在现实生活中，那个山谷里并没有村庄。然而，也许这幅画表现了梵高用他的心灵之眼所能看到的更深层次的现实。虽然画面黑暗而安静，但画中却充满了光明和生命。它也许能让我们一窥梵高复杂的思想和天才。

## HABITS FOR A HEALTHY LIFESTYLE

健康的生活方式需养成的习惯

As teenagers grow up, they become more independent and start making their own decisions. However, during this period, it can be easy for some of them to form bad habits. These bad habits, if left unchecked, could lead to more serious ones when they become adults. For example, some of them may become involved in **tobacco** or **alcohol** **abuse**, which can lead to physical and mental health problems. To prevent harmful habits like these from **dominating** a teenager's life is essential. They must learn to recognise bad habits early and make appropriate changes.

在成长过程中，青少年会变得越来越独立，并且开始自己做决定。然而，在这一时期，他们中的一部分人容易养成不良习惯。如果任其发展，在他们长大成人后，这些不良习惯可能会导致更为严重的有害习惯。例如，一些青少年可能吸烟成瘾或酗酒，造成身心健康问题。防止此类有害习惯主宰青少年的生活是至关重要的。他们必须学会早早认清不良习惯并作出适当的改变。

To change bad habits is never easy, even with many attempts. There is a famous saying based on the philosophy of Aristotle: "We are what we repeatedly do. " In many ways, our lifestyle is the sum of choices we have made. We make a choice to do something, and then we repeat it over and over again. Soon that choice becomes automatic and forms a habit that is much harder to change. The good news is that we can change, if we understand how habits work

改变不良习惯从来都不是一件容易的事情，即使你三番五次地尝试。有句基于亚里士多德哲学的名言:“我们反复做的事情造就了我们。”从很多方面看，我们的生活方式是我们所作出的选择的总和。我们选择做某件事，接着我们反反复复地做这件事。不久之后，这项选择就变得自然而然，成为一种更加难以改变的习惯。好消息是，如果我们了解习惯是怎么运作的，我们就可以作出改变。

According to modern **psychology**, we must first learn about the "habit cycle", which works like this：根据现代心理学，我们必须首先了解“习惯循环”，其工作原理如下:

- Firstly， there is a “cue” , an action， event，or situation that acts as a signal to do something.

第一是“触发因素”，即一个行动、事件或状况，充当要做某事的讯号。

- Secondly, there is a "routine", the regular *action* you *take* in response to the cue.

第二是“惯常行为”，即你响应触发因素而采取的常规行动。

- Thirdly, there is the "**reward**", the good thing or feeling we get from the routine.

第三是“回报”，即我们从惯常行为中获得的美好事物或感受。

For example, when we feel unhappy (cue), we eat lots of unhealthy snacks (routine) which makes us feel happy (reward). The reward makes us much more likely to continue the cycle, and the bad habit of **relying** on unhealthy snacks is formed

例如，当我们感到不高兴时(触发因素)，我们会吃很多不健康零食(惯常行为)，这让我们感到快乐(回报)。这一回报使我们更有可能继续这一循环，从而形成了依赖不健康零食这不良习惯

To **facilitate** a positive change in our bad habits, we must first **examine** our bad habit cycles and then try adapt them. We can do this by combining the information from our habit cycles with our own positive ideas. For example, we could try to replace a **negative** routine with something more positive. So, when we feel unhappy again (cue), rather than eat snacks, we could listen to some of our favourite music instead (routine) which will make us feel relaxed (reward). Aside from changing bad habits, we can also use the habit cycle to create good habits. For example, when we come to an escalator (cue), our normal routine is to ride it, but we could change this routine into something more positive by taking the stairs instead.

为了促进我们不良习惯的积极改变，我们必须首先审视我们的不良习惯循环，然后尝试去改变它们。为了做到这一点，我们可以把来自我们不良习惯循环的信息与我们自己的积极想法结合起来。例如，我们可以试着将一个消极的惯常行为替换为一个更积极的东西。因此，当我们再次感到不高兴时(触发因素)，我们可以听几首自己最喜爱的音乐(惯常行为)，而不是吃零食，这会使我们感到放松(回报)。除了改变不良习惯之外，我们还可以利用习惯循环来养成良好的习惯。例如，当我们走到电梯前的时候(触发因素)，我们的惯常行为是乘坐电梯，但是我们可以改为走楼梯，从而将上述惯常行为改变为一个更积极的事情。

Many of us try to change bad habits quickly, and if we are not successful straight away we often become **pessimistic** and give up. In fact, the most successful way to change is not suddenly, but over a period of time. As the Chinese philosopher Lao Zi wrote, “A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.” One step seems small, but it is essential. To reach the goal of change, a person must show some **discipline** and repeatedly take many small steps. After all, it is not easy to break bad habits

我们中很多人试图迅速改变不良习惯，一旦没有立刻成功，我们往往变得悲观，继而放弃。事实上，改变不良习惯的最佳方法不是一蹴而就，而是需要一段时间。正如中国哲学家老子所说:“千里之行，始于足下。” 一步似乎很小，却至关重要。为了实现改变这一目标，一个人必须展示出一定程度的自制力，不断地出许多小步。毕竟，戒除不良习惯并非易事。

For young people, there is plenty of time to change bad habits. However, there is no “magic **pill**” or delete button that will help you; you have to think about your bad habits and decide on some changes. You have the power to build a happy and healthy life full of good habits!

对年轻人来说，有大量的时间可以改变不良习惯。然而，能帮助你的“魔力丸”或删除键并不存在;你必须思考自己的不良习惯，选定一些作出改变。你有能力构建一种充满良好习惯的快乐、健康的生活!

Dear Editor尊敬的编辑

After I attended your summer camp about health and lifestyle choices, I realised I hardly ever felt well, either physically or mentally often felt sleepy and **dizzy**, and lacked passion. Most worrying, though, I got the **flu** easily and experienced many toothaches, too

参加了你们举办的有关健康和生活方式选择的夏令营之后，我意识到我几乎从来没有感觉好过，无论在身体上还是心理上。我经常感到昏昏欲睡和头晕目眩。不过最令人担忧的是，我很容易得流感，而且经常牙痛

At the end of the camp I heard, "Change the world by changing yourself. " This **stimulated** my motivation. A **dentist** once examined me and told me that too much sugar in my meals had damaged my teeth and health. I made up my mind to change two things in my life: to eat nothing with sugar and to exercise regularly

在夏令营尾声，我听到“改变世界，从改变自己做起”这句话，这激发了我的动力。有次，牙医给我做检查时告诉我，我的三餐摄入了过量糖分，损害了我的牙齿和健康。我下定决心改变我生活中的两件事:不吃含糖的任何东西，定期锻炼身体。

After that I stopped buying all the sweets, biscuits, and sugary drinks that I used to have every day. Whenever I went out with friends, brought snacks from home, things that didn’t have any added sugar: fruit, **nuts**, dried meat, etc.

此后，我不再买我过去每天都要吃的糖果、饼干和含糖饮料。每次和朋友们出去时，我都会从家里带零食，也就是没有添加任何糖分的东西:水果、坚果、肉干等。

My exercise was very simple: I went outside every day for at least 30 minutes and did something active. Sometimes I played table tennis or badminton with my cousins. Other times I jumped on my **skateboard** and rode around my neighbourhood, or just took a long walk

我的锻炼很简单:我每天在室外积极活动至少30分钟。有时，我会和堂(表)亲打乒乓球或羽毛球;有时，我会跳上滑板，在街区滑行，或是长时间散步。

The results have been fantastic. I feel more **dynamic** and stronger than ever, in both body and mind. I sleep soundly at night now. I no longer suffer from a flu virus or toothaches either. Best of all, in my opinion, is how I feel about myself. I feel like I'm in control of my own life. To make choices about myself is within my own power. I CAN change myself. I just need to try.

结果棒极了。在身心上，我感觉比以往任何时候都更有活力、更加强壮。现在，夜里我能酣然入睡。我也不再受流感病毒或牙痛的折磨。我认为，最棒的是我对自己的感觉。我感到我能掌控自己的生活。为自己作出选择是我力所能及的。我能够改变自己。我只需去尝试。

Dear Editor尊敬的编辑:

As I took part in the summer camp about personal life choices, I started to analyse my choices, especially what I did to relax and how it was affecting my whole life.

自从参加了有关个人生活选择的夏令营后，我开始分析自己的选择，尤其是我做了些什么来放松自己，以及它是如何影响我的整个生活的。

After starting high school, I felt stressed out and always relaxed by playing computer games. I got so absorbed that I played the games day and night. Playing was fun, but I felt even more worn out afterwards! So after the camp, I realised that it was very, very important to adjust my lifestyle. I decided to take control of my life and find other ways to relax.

高中开始后，我感到压力重重，总是通过玩电脑游戏来放松自己。我十分着迷，没日没夜地打游戏。打游戏很好玩，但过后我却感到更加疲惫不堪!因此，夏令营之后，我意识到调整自己的生活方式是非常重要的。我决定掌控自己的生活，寻找其他的放松方式。

It was a big struggle not to join my friends in playing online games as I'm mad for them. However, I realised that to succeed in quitting, I had to replace it with something else. So I thought about what to try. Rock climbing, **bowling**, watching **comedies**, and playing basketball were the things I thought of doing instead.

不和我的朋友们一起玩网络游戏是一件十分困难的事情，因为我痴迷其中。不过我意识到要想成功戒瘾，我必须用别的东西来取代它。于是，我思考该尝试些什么。攀岩、打保龄球、看喜剧片、打篮球都是我考虑过的取而代之的事情。

Now my dad and I go rock climbing together **monthly**! It has **enhanced** the quality of my life, improving my health and increasing my happiness. I get **refreshed** through climbing, spend more time with my dad, and get to meet new friends.

现在，爸爸每个月与我结伴去攀岩。这改善了我的健康，增加了我的幸福感，(从而)提高了我的生活品质。禁岩使我精神焕发，与爸爸共度了更多的时光，而且结交了新的朋友。

After six months of trying out new ways of relaxing, I feel much more energetic. I feel that I can change myself for the better. And if that's true for me, then it might truly be possible to change the world for the better. As Gandhi said “Be the change you want to see in the world.”

尝试新的放松方式六个月后，我感到精力充沛多了。我感觉我可以让自己变得更好。如果这对我来说是真的，那么也许真的有可能让世界变得更加美好。正如甘地所说:“欲变世界，先变其身。”

Sincerely,

此致

敬礼!

MY EXPERIENCES WITH COMPUTER GAMES

我的电脑游戏经历

I clearly remember the first time I played a computer game. I was seven years old. My friend had gotten a computer for his birthday. He invited me to play a game, which was very simple by today’s standards, but we loved it! We played for hours. We would meet after school every day to play it. My addiction to computer games started then. Not long after that, my friend moved to the city. I missed him, but got my own computer and began playing by myself

我清楚地记得我第一次玩电脑游戏的情景。那时我七岁。我的朋友在生日时得到了一台电脑。他邀请我玩一个游戏，以今天的标准来看，这个游戏非常简单，但我们很喜欢！我们玩了几个小时。我们每天放学后都会聚在一起玩。我对电脑游戏的瘾就是从那时开始的。不久之后，我的朋友搬到了城里。我很想他，但我有了自己的电脑，开始自己玩。

Over the years, computer games developed rapidly. Technology improved, and there were always new and better games to play. You could then play games over the Internet with people from al over the world, using either computers or smartphones. The online games were fascinating and it was always exciting to play.

多年来，电脑游戏发展迅速。技术进步了，总是有新的更好的游戏可以玩。那时，你可以通过互联网与来自世界各地的人一起玩游戏，使用电脑或智能手机。网上的游戏很吸引人，玩起来总是很刺激。

At first, I played games over the Internet after I had done my homework and eaten dinner. Then I started playing as soon as I got home each day, My parents stopped me, so I started playing it in the middle of the night. I went to school and often fell asleep in class. My teacher would scold me but I would often do the same thing the next day! Shortly after that, I began to skip meals and play through the night. My parents found out and took away my computer and smartphone. I knew I had gone too far. My love of computer games had become an addiction. It was affecting my schoolwork and my health, and I felt quite depressed

起初，我是在做完作业和吃完饭后才在网上玩游戏。后来，我每天一回家就开始玩，爸爸妈妈阻止了我，于是我就在半夜开始玩。我去上学，经常在课堂上睡着了。老师会责骂我，但第二天我还是这样做同样的事情!在那之后不久，我开始不吃饭，整晚玩游戏。！父母发现后，把我的电脑和智能手机都拿走了。我知道自己做得太过分了。我对电脑游戏的热爱已经成瘾。影响了我的功课和健康，我觉得很沮丧.

Then one day I bumped into my friend again! He had moved back to our hometown. We hadn't seen each other for ages. He looked happy and healthy. We talked about the past and the good times we had, playing that old game. He still played computer games, but he also did many other things. He invited me to play basketball with some friends. I got tired quickly, but I loved it! Afterwards, we played a board game. We laughed and talked and played for hours. It was very sociable and great fun. Playing games with my friends in real life was much more enjoyable than doing so online.

后来有一天，我又碰到了我的朋友! 他已经搬回了我们的家乡。我们已经很久没有见面了。他看起来很开心，很健康。我们聊起了过去，聊起了我们的美好时光，玩起了那个老游戏。他还是玩电脑游戏，但他也做了很多其他的事情。他邀请我和一些朋友打篮球。我很快就累了，但我很喜欢。之后，我们玩了一个棋牌游戏。我们笑着说话，玩了好几个小时。这是一个非常有趣的社交活动。在现实生活中和我的朋友玩游戏比在网上玩游戏更有趣。

Computer games are great fun and I still play them sometimes. New technology is making more amazing things possible. I've learnt that some games can even teach us to train our brains to solve problems. However, games can also be addictive, so balance is important for a healthy lifestyle. We can spoil good things by doing them too much. Now I enjoy playing games even more because I am able to maintain a good balance between work and play.

电脑游戏非常有趣，我有时还是会玩。新技术让更多神奇的事情成为可能。我了解到，有些游戏甚至可以教我们训练大脑解决问题。然而，游戏也会让人上瘾，所以平衡对于健康的生活方式很重要。我们会因为做得太多而破坏了美好的事物。现在我更喜欢玩游戏，因为我能够在工作和游戏之间保持良好的平衡。

## **CLIMATE CHANGE REQUIRES THE WORLD'S ATTENTION**

气候变化需要全世界的共同关注

We have known about climate change for decades. There is little doubt that Earth is getting warmer and warmer (see the graph). A warming ocean and atmosphere along with melting ice and rising sea levels provide evidence of a dramatic change in the global climate.

我们了解气候变化已经有几十年了。毫无疑问，地球是在变得越来越暖(见表)。海洋和气候变暖以及冰的融化和海平面的上升为全球气候的剧烈变化提供了证据。

In 2013, a lot of people were shocked by a news photo of a dead polar bear that was found on Norway’s Arctic island of Svalbard. According to the scientists who found its dead body, all that remained of the polar bear was "skin and bones ". An expert who has studied polar bears for many years said that from the position of its dead body, the bear appeared to have **starved** and died. Experts claimed that low sea-ice levels caused by climate change meant that the bear could not hunt seals as before, so it had to travel greater distances in order to find food. This alarming case showed how the increase in temperature had an impact on Earth’s **ecology**.

2013年，一张关于那威北极岛的斯瓦尔巴群岛上发现一只北极熊死亡的新闻照片，震惊了很多人。根据发现北极熊尸体的科学家的说法，北极熊只剩下“皮肤和骨头”。一位研究北极熊多年的专家说，从北极熊尸体的位置看，北极熊似乎饿死了。专家声称，由于气候变化导致海冰面积下降，这只熊无法像以前那样捕猎海豹，因此它不得不走很远的距离才能找到食物。这个令人震惊的案例表明，温度升高如何影响地球的生态。

Then what is causing the increase in the global average surface temperature? Climate scientists often mention a key climate process called the "greenhouse effect " which has two common meanings: the "natural greenhouse effect and the "man-made greenhouse effect. The "natural "greenhouse effect refers to the fact that heat from the sun enters the atmosphere and warms Earth's surface as short-wave radiation. The heat is **released** back into space at longer wave lengths. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, such as methane and **carbon** dioxide, trap some of the heat, keeping Earth's climate warm and habitable. Without this process, Earth could not **sustain** life. However, the "man-made greenhouse effect" has now become a big problem. When people produce huge amounts of extra greenhouse gases by burning fossil **fuels**, more heat energy is trapped in the atmosphere and causes Earth's surface temperature to rise.

那么，是什么导致全球平均表面温度上升?气候科学家经常提到一个称为“温室效应”的重要气候过程，它有两个普遍的含义：“自然”温室效应和“人造”温室效应。“自然”温室效应是指太阳的热量进入大气层，并以短波辐射的形式使地球表面变暖。热量以更长的波长释放回太空。大气层中的温室气体(如甲烷和二氧化碳)吸收了部分热量，使地球的气候温暖宜居。没有这个过程，地球将无法维持生命。然而，“人造”温室效应现在已成为一个大问题。当人们燃烧化石燃料产生大量额外的温室气体时，更多的热量被困在大气层中，从而引起地球表面温度迅速上升。

There is strong and **comprehensive** evidence that the rise in temperature has led to an increase in extreme weather and natural disasters worldwide, not only causing serious damage, but also costing human lives. Climate scientists have warned that if we do not take appropriate actions, this warming trend will probably continue and there will be a higher price to pay. In fact, news reports are **frequently** **broadcast** about extreme rainstorms and heatwaves causing deaths and economic losses。

有充分而全面的证据表明，温度升高导致全世界范围内极端天气和自然灾害增加，不仅造成了严重的破坏，而且还造成了人员伤亡。气候科学家警告说，如果我们不采取适当的行动，这种变暖趋势可能会持续下去，并且需要付出更高的代价。事实上，新闻报道经常播出极端暴雨和热浪造成死亡和经济损失。

Continued greenhouse gas emissions will result in further warming and long-lasting changes to the global climate. This requires the attention of people all over the world. Governments need to consider making **policies** and taking appropriate actions and measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We as individuals can also reduce our "carbon footprint" by **restricting** the amount of carbon dioxide our lifestyles produce. It is our responsibility to **seize** every opportunity to educate everyone about global warming, along with its causes and impacts, because this is the most serious issue affecting all of us on this planet. So what will you do to help?

持续的温室气体排放将导致全球气候进一步变暖和持久变化。这需要全世界人民的关注。政府需要考虑制定政策，采取适当的行动和措施以少温室气体排放。我们个人也可以通过限制生活方式产生的二氧化碳量来减少“碳足迹”。抓住每一个机会，对所有人进行全球变暖及其成因和影响的教育，这是我们的责任，因为这是影响我们地球上所有人最严重的问题。那你会怎么做?

**REDUCING WATER POLLUTION IN THE LI RIVER**

减少漓江的水污染

The beautiful Li River and its amazing surrounding scenery is one of the most well-known tourist destinations in Chinas Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. It attracts millions of domestic and foreign visitors each year. However, its reputation as a top destination has had negative effects on the river's water quality. This report looks at the problem of water pollution and some actions that have been taken to deal with it.

美丽的漓江及其迷人的风景是中西壮族自治区最著名的旅游胜地之一。它每年吸引数百万的国内外游客。然而，它作为顶级旅游胜地的声誉对河流的水质产生了负面影响。这份报告着眼于水污染问题以及为解决这个间题而采取的一些行动。

Previously, water quality in the Li River had suffered greatly from an increasing **volume** of tourists, many of whom frequently threw **garbage** into the river. Many tour boats contributed to the problem too. Kitchens on board were using lots of oil. which was often thrown into the water. The growth in tourism also meant the local population rose rapidly, as well as the number of commercial and industrial **enterprises**. Water pollution levels increased, with more household and commercial waste ending up in the river. In order to feed more people, more chemicals were used to increase crop production. These chemicals led to severe water quality issues, causing a decrease in the number of fish species. Local officials were concerned that the pollution was damaging the natural environment and felt that urgent steps should be taken to **restore** the rivers original beauty

以往，漓江的水质因游客量的增长遭到了严重破坏，一些游客频繁将垃圾扔进江中。许多旅游船也导致了这个问题。船上的厨房用了大量的油，这些油经常被扔入水中。旅游业的增长也意味着当地人口以及商业和工业企业的数量迅速増加。水污染水平上升，更多的家庭和商业废物最终流入河中。为了养活更多的人，使用了更多的化学药品来增加农作物的产量。这些化学物质导致严重的水质问题，导致鱼类种类减少。当地官员担心污染正在破坏自然环境，并认为应采取紧急措施恢复河流的原始美景。

A comprehensive initiative was started, with a number of measures that addressed the issues. The construction of waste water treatment facilities improved the water quality and water **conservation**. The collection and transport of household waste was also improved. **Dozens** of polluting enterprises were closed or moved. The local government set up strict regulations regarding further industrial development. New rules were also introduced regarding tour boat routes and garbage disposal methods. Furthermore, the local authorities began to use the media to spread environmental awareness and encourage greater use of clean energy. At the same time, they started to carry out **inspections** regularly and **fine** tourist organisations for abuses. With these measures, it is believed that the beauty of the Li River will be preserved for generations to come

一项全面倡议启动了，采取了若干措施解这些问题。污水处理设施的建设改善了水质，节约了用水。生活垃圾的收集和运输也得到了改善。数十家污染企业被关闭或搬迁。地方政府对进一步发展工业制定了严格的规定。有关旅游船路线和垃圾处理方法的新规定也已出台。此外，地方当局开始利用媒体宣传环境意识，鼓励更多地使用清洁能源。同时，他们开始定期进行检查，并对旅游组织的陋习进行罚款。相信通过这些措施，漓江之美将得以世代相传。

In addition， the ambitious＂Water Ten Plan＂ is also now tackling water pollution across the country. Other initiatives， such as the＂River Chief System＂， hold senior officials responsible for reducing water pollution. With such **campaigns** in effect， Chinas waterways are heading towards a clean and sustainable future另外，“水十条”的宏伟规划则是为了治理整个国家的水污染问题。例如“河长制”这样的举措让高级官员承担起减少水污染的职。随着这些行动(的展开)，中国的水资源正朝着洁净的、可持续发展的未来迈进。

SMALL WASTE, BIG PROBLEM

小垃圾，大问题

Many of us might not give a second thought to dropping a small piece of litter. After all it is so small, it cannot possibly be that harmful, can it? In today’s world, the answer is certainly "Yes it can! With the growing use of plastic bags and the rising number of smokers, there is more litter being produced than ever before.

我们很多人可能都不会去考虑掉一小块垃圾。毕竟它这么小，不可能有那么大的危害吧？在当今世界，答案当然是 "是的，有！"。随着塑料袋的使用和吸烟者的增加，产生的垃圾比以往任何时候都多。

Although cigarette butts are small, they are bad for the environment. Worldwide, about 4.3 trillion cigarette butts are littered every year. As well as spoiling the beauty of the environment, they contain toxic chemicals. These find their way into the water supply where they affect water quality and endanger plants and animals. Cigarette butts can take up to 25 years to break down, and the toxic chemicals add up to a large amount with so many littered. So, if people want to smoke they should dispose of the butts properly in a rubbish bin.

烟头虽小，却对环境有害。全世界每年约有4.3万亿个烟头被乱扔。除了破坏环境的美丽，它们还含有有毒的化学物质。这些物质会进入水源，影响水质，危害动植物。烟头需要长达25年的时间才能分解，而有毒的化学物质会随着这么多烟头的乱扔而大量增加。所以，如果人们想吸烟，应该把烟蒂妥善地丢弃在垃圾箱里。

Plastic bags are another common form of litter that is dangerous to the environment. They are easily blown by wind and float in water, so they can travel long distances. They find their way to rivers, parks, beaches and oceans, killing many birds, mammals, fish, and sea animals each year worldwide. They can last for hundreds of years in the environment. We should not let plastic bags become litter. We should use fewer plastic bags, and reuse and recycle what we have already used.

塑料袋是另一种常见的对环境有危害的垃圾。它们很容易被风吹动，漂浮在水面上，所以它们可以长途跋涉。它们进入河流、公园、海滩和海洋，每年在世界各地杀死许多鸟类、哺乳动物、鱼类和海洋动物。它们可以在环境中持续数百年。我们不应该让塑料袋成为垃圾。我们应该减少使用塑料袋，并将已经使用过的塑料袋再利用和回收。

One way to reduce the use of plastic bags is to charge for them. Shops used to give plastic bags for free. But in some countries, including China, customers are now charged for each bag. Some shops also have a "bag-for-life" scheme. They sell stronger bags that can be reused, and they replace them for free if the bags ever break.

减少使用塑料袋的方法之一是收费。以前商店都会免费赠送塑料袋。但在包括中国在内的一些国家，现在却要向顾客收取每个袋子的费用。有些商店还实行 "可重复使用的环保购物袋"计划。他们出售可以重复使用的更结实的袋子，如果袋子破损，他们会免费更换。

Waste is a big problem for the environment, so we need to do something. Not littering at all or cleaning up "small waste " saves money spent on disposing of litter properly. However, it would be better not to smoke or use plastic bags at all。

垃圾是环境的一个大问题，所以我们需要做点什么。完全不乱扔垃圾或清理 "小垃圾"，可以节省用于妥善处理垃圾的费用。但是，最好不要吸烟或使用塑料袋。

A SUCCESSFUL FAILURE

一次成功的失败经历

Perce Blackborow joined an expedition with Sir Ernest Shackleton to Antarctica on the ship Endurance in 1914. Shackleton was one of the most famous explorers of his day and it was considered a great honour to be part of his expeditions. Below are some of Blackborow' s diary entries.

珀西布菜克博罗于1914年加入欧内斯特沙克尔顿爵的“坚忍”号轮船南极探险之旅。沙克尔顿是他那个时代最负盛名的探险家，加入他的探险活动被认为是一种巨大的荣耀。下面是布菜克博罗的一些日记。

31 October,1914

1914年10月31日

…Well, it so happened that one morning I bought a newspaper and read the advertisement about the Antarctic expedition.

…好吧，碰巧有一天早上我买了份报纸，看了一则关于南极探险队的广告。

An expedition to the South Pole with the great Sir Ernest Shackleton—this is the adventure that I have been dreaming of. And I was ready for it. At the age of 19, I am fit and full of vigour. However, when I applied to join the expedition Shackleton turned me down because he thought I was too young and wasn’t qualified. But I was so **enthusiastic** about the idea of going along with them that I secretly went **aboard** his ship, the Endurance, and hid in a small **cupboard**. Unfortunately, three days after we set off I was discovered. Shackleton did not want to turn back so he offered me a job， but only after he promised me, If anyone has to be eaten， then you will be the first! He **assigned** me to be a steward, and I now serve meals for twenty-eight men, three times a day.

同伟大的欧内斯特沙克尔顿爵士去南极探险——这是我梦寐以求的冒险。我已经准备好了。19岁的时候，我身体健康而且精力充沛。然而，当我申请加入探险队时，沙克尔顿拒绝了我，因为他认为我太年轻，不合格。但我对与他们同行的想法非常感兴趣，于是我偷偷地上了“坚忍”号轮船，在一个小橱里。不幸的是，我们出发三天后，我被发现了。沙克尔顿不想回头，所以他给我提供了一份工作，但他保证，“如果有人要被吃掉，那你就是第一个!”他让我当一名伙计，我现在做28个人一天三顿的饭菜。

How everyone will **envy** me when I come back and tell them about the amazing laces I have been to.

当我回来告诉他们我去过的神奇的地方时，大家好该会多么羨慕我啊!

21 Nov 1915

1915年11月21日

The journey has not been easy. Endurance became stuck in the ice as we approached Antarctica. The ice froze around us and we were well and truly stuck! We saw the ship get crushed by the ice. And when the ship **sank**, our hearts sank with it.

这段路程并不轻松。正当我们接近南极时，“坚忍”号被海土的浮冰卡住了。周围的冰都冻结了，我们千真万确地被困住了!我们看到船被冰挤坏了。当船沉没时，我们的心也随之沉没

Before we **abandoned** the ship, Shackleton calmly called us together and told us to rescue our most essential supplies—the small boats, our food, the cook stove candles, clothes, and **blankets**. This was no time to panic. We were not allowed to take most of our personal belongings, and Shackleton himself threw away all his gold. But to our surprise, he allowed Hussey to keep his banjo. Hussey often plays it to keep our spirits up.

在我们弃船之前，沙克尔顿镇静地把我们召集在一起，告诉我们要抢出我们最基本的给养——小船、食物、炉子、蜡烛、衣服和毯子。现在不是恐慌的时候。我们不准带走大部分私人物品，沙克尔顿自己也扔掉了所有的金子。但令我们感到惊讶的是，他让赫西留着他的班卓琴。赫西经常弹班卓琴来保持我们的精神振奋。

We are now camped on the ice and we have been managing to survive, but spring is coming, and the ice will soon begin to melt.

我们现在在冰上扎营，我们一直在设法生存，但春天来了，冰很快就会开始融化。

20May,1916

1916年5月20日

We have been struggling for days, but things on Elephant Island are going from bad to worse. We are now crowded together under one of our boats on the rock shore of this miserable place. Soon after we arrived, Shackleton left us to find help on South Georgia Island, 1, 320 kilometres away—the voyage was too dangerous and difficult for all of us to make it in our small boats. If Shackleton fails, will we have any hope of rescue? No. No **navy** in the world ever stops at Elephant Island and no one else knows that we are here.

我们已经苦苦挣扎了好几天，但是大象岛上的情况越来越糟。我们现在挤在一条船上，在这个悲惨的地方的岩石海岸上。我们到达后不久，沙克尔顿就离开我们，去1320公里外的南乔治亚求援，这趟航程太危险和困难了我们所有人都无法乘小船上路。如果沙克尔顿失败，我们是否有营救的希望吗?不，世界上没有任何海军在大象岛停留过，也没有人知道我们在这里。

I feel low. It's cold and windy. The island has no plants. Sometimes we are able to catch a seal or a penguin to eat. Otherwise, there is no food. I try to think of happier things: **decent** food, warm and dry clothes, a cosy bedroom, sunny days, and my mother’s face . However, these happy memories are soon interrupted by a sudden cold rush of air.

我感到情绪低落。寒冷多风，岛上没有植物。有时我们能抓住海豹或企鹅来吃。否则，就没有食物了。我尝试着想一些更快乐的事情:体面的食物暖和的衣服、舒适的卧室、阳光明媚的日子以及妈妈的脸…然而，这些美好的回忆很快就被突如其来的冷风打断了。

I shouted. “Shut the door.” 我大喊:“关上门!

“Hold on now, Perce. Don't you go turning into another Tom,” came the reply.

“We've caught another penguin, so it's penguin soup tonight!”

“要坚持住啊，珀西。你可不要变成另一个汤姆。”传来一声回答，“我们又抓了一只企鹅，所以今晚是企鹅汤!![](C:/Users/32068/Desktop/media/image1.png)”

Bless Frank Wild, the kindest man there is after our leader, Ernest Shackleton.

How could I become as selfish and bad-tempered as Thomas Orde-lees!

保佑弗兰克・怀尔德，我们的领袖欧内斯特・沙克尔顿之外最善良的人。我怎么能变得像托马斯・奥德・里斯一样自私又脾气暴躁!

Without Frank and Ernest, we’d all be dead by now. Their **genuine** concern for others, their perseverance, and their **resolve** fill me with hope.

如果没有弗兰克和欧内斯特，我们现在都已经死了。他们对他人的真诚关心，他们的毅力和决心使我充满希望。

Perhaps there is a chance we will return home, after all毕竟，我们内部也许还是有机会回家的。

THE REWARD FOR PERSEVERANCE

锲而不舍的回报

We watched as Shackleton and the boat sailed away from Elephant Island. It was easy to imagine the danger ahead of them. Would they ever return to find us? What might happen to them? What if they were delayed? We fell so alone and desperate. But it was not for long. There was nothing like a good dinner and some music to cheer us up.

我们看着沙克尔顿和小船驶离大象岛。很容易想象他们将面临的危险。他们会回来找我们吗?他们可能会发生什么?如果他们被耽搁了怎么办?我们感到如此孤独和绝望。不过，这并没有持续很长时间。没有什么比得上一顿好饭和一点儿音乐能让我们振作起来了。

Life fell into a regular pattern. Staying alive took all our time and energy. For example, we needed water, and Elephant Island had none. We found that we could melt ice from the ocean and drink the water from it. But how could we make fire? There were no trees growing on Antarctica and no oil, so the only fuel we could use was animal fat. This gave off oily, black smoke, but it stayed burning even in strong winds.

生活转入了常规。活下去耗费了我们所有的时间和精力。例如:我们需要水，而大象岛没有水。我们发现我们可以融化海洋中的冰块并饮用其中的水。但我们怎么生火呢?南极地区不长树，也没有油料，所以唯一可供我们用作燃料的便是动物脂肪。燃烧脂肪会产生油膩的黑烟，但它即使在强风中也能燃烧。

Food was also a problem, as we did not find any vegetables or fruit on the island. One of our group members, Lionel Greenstreet, noted in his diary about how bored he was with the meals: "The food now is pretty well all meat of sea creatures. If it weren’t for sea animals, we would all starve. As a chef. it was my duty to cook, so I tried to vary the meals in whatever way I could. But it was difficult.

食物也是个问题，因为我们在岛上没有找到蔬菜和水果。我们小组的一员，菜昂内尔・格林斯特里特在日记中提到他对菜是何其厌烦:“现在食物全是海洋生物的肉。”如果不是海洋动物，我们都会挨。作为厨师，做饭是我的职责，所以我想方设法去变化伙食的花样。但这可真不容易。

We had to be careful not to go outside too often, as the changing temperatures could make us ill. It was almost as dangerous to become too hot from wearing too many clothes as to become too cold from wearing too few. The sweat could freeze very quickly. Many of us also became ill from the black smoke of the animal fat we burnt for our fires. It damaged our eyes and burnt our lungs.

我们必须小心，不要经常出门，因为变幻的温度可能会使我们生病。穿衣服太多而太热同穿得太少而变冷差不多一样危险。汗水可能很快就会结成冰。我们中的许多人还因为燃烧动物脂肪产生的黑烟而生病。它伤了我们的眼睛，烧伤了我们的肺。

The twenty-two of us lived like this in the cold for four months. Our discipline and team spirit kept us optimistic and helped us deal with our fears in a positive and successful way. We also celebrated our birthdays, festivals, and even the times when we caught a sea animal. This was an **episode** in my life that I would never forget.

我们22个人就这样在寒冷中生活了四个月。我们的纪律和团队合作精神使我们保持乐观，并帮助我们以积极的态度成功地克服了恐惧。我们还庆祝生日、庆祝节日，甚至捕获到一只海洋动物也庆祝一番。这是我一生中永远不会忘记的一段插曲。

When we were finally rescued, we felt such relief and joy that many of us could not hide our tears. We were at last free to go home to warm beds, good food and the care of our family and friends. Our optimism and faith in Shackleton lad helped us persevere in staying alive. And he paid us back by his **commitment** to save us from a slow but painful death.

当我们最终获救时，我们长长得松了口气，欣喜不已，许多人忍不住流下了眼泪。我们终于可以自由地回家，躺在温暖的床上，品尝可口的食物，享受家庭和朋友的关爱了。乐观和对沙克尔顿的信任帮助我们坚持顽强地活了下来。他给我们的回报则是承诺返回岛上，并且把我们从缓慢而又痛苦的死亡中解救出来。

FAN ZHONGYAN

范仲淹

Perhaps one of the most famous sayings in China is, "To be the first to feel concern for the troubles of the world, and the last to enjoy its pleasures. " Written by Fan Zhongyan, this 11th century proverb provides a goal for all Chinese government officials to aspire to.

也许中国最著名的一句话是："先天下之忧而忧，后天下之乐而乐"。" 这句11世纪的谚语由范仲淹所写，为所有中国政府官员提供了一个向往的目标。

Fan Zhongyan(989-1052) himself was a good example of someone who lived by these words. Fan was born in Suzhou in 989 CE. When he was just one or two years old, his father died and his mother married another man From a very young age, he was very diligent in his schoolwork. Later, he left his stepfather’s family and had to stay in a temple, where he was only able to eat porridge each day. In the winter, he had to cut frozen porridge into pieces for his meals. It is said that one day one of his friends noticed that he was not eating well, so he sent over some tasty food. Fan refused to touch it, saying that he wanted to be content with what he had.

范仲淹(989-1052)本人就是践行这句话的典范。范仲淹于公元989年出生在苏州。在他一两岁的时候，父亲去世，母亲改嫁，他从小就非常勤奋学习。后来，他离开继父家，只好住在寺庙里，每天只能吃粥。冬天的时候，他只好把冻粥切成块来吃。据说有一天，他的一个朋友发现他吃得不好，就送了一些好吃的东西过来。范仲淹不肯碰，说要知足常乐。

In 1015, Fan passed the imperial examination and became a government official. While he served in Taizhou, he always had the peoples best interest at heart, and so he proposed building a sea wall to protect homes from flooding. This sea wall was later called "Lord Fans Embankment". Serving with distinction, he helped build up defenses when the country was threatened by war. Then, once the country was at peace again, he was promoted to a high level position in the capital, where he was able to advise the emperor on government policy.

1015年，范仲淹通过科举考试，做了官。在台州任职期间，他始终以人民的利益为重，于是他提议修建一道海墙，保护家园不受水灾侵袭。这道海墙后来被称为 "范大人堤"。他功勋卓著，当国家受到战争威胁时，他就帮助建立防御设施。后来，国家再次和平后，他就被提拔到京城担任高官，可以为皇帝提供政府政策方面的建议。

As an advisor to the emperor, Fan then tried to institute government reforms, known as the Qingli reforms. However, many conservative bureaucrats opposed him, and so the reforms were stopped and Fan was forced to leave the capital and go into exile.

作为皇帝的顾问，范仲淹便试图推行政府改革，即所谓的庆历改革。然而，许多保守的官僚反对他，因此改革被停止，范仲淹被迫离开京城，流放在外。

While in exile in 1045, Fan wrote an essay entitled Memorial to Yueyang Tower. In the essay, he wondered if it was possible to find government officials who would be firm in their desire to look after the needs of the common people, and not worry about their own personal welfare.

1045年流放期间，范仲淹写了一篇题为《岳阳楼纪》的文章。在文章中，他想，是否可以找到一些政府官员，坚定不移地照顾老百姓的需要，不为自己的个人福利担忧。

Of such a man, Fan said, " When serving in a high office at court, he will be concerned for the people; if living on distant rivers and lakes, he will be concerned for his sovereign. When serving, he worries, while in retirement. he worries. And when does he enjoy himself ? One must say: To be the first to feel concern for the troubles of the world and the last to enjoy its pleasures. "

“居庙堂之高则忧其民，处江湖之远则忧其君。是进亦忧，退亦忧。然则何时而乐耶？其必曰“先天下之忧而忧，后天下之乐而乐” 微斯人，吾谁与归？

After Fan retired, he bought a farm and used it to provide jobs for local people. The profits from the farm were then used to pay for the education of poor children. Though by this time he was a wealthy man, he spent all of his money helping others and lived a very simple life.

范仲淹退休后，买了农田雇佣当地人。然后把农田的利润用来支付贫困儿童的教育费用。虽然这个时候他已经是一个富翁了，但是他把所有的钱都用来帮助别人，自己生活非常简单。

It is refreshing to think that there was once such a person who did not just speak wise words to live by, but who also put those words into practice during his own life. Fan Zhongyan was such a man.

想到曾经有这样一个人，他不仅说了明智的话作为生活的依据，而且还在自己的一生中将这些话付诸实践，真是令人耳目一新的。范仲淹就是这样一个人。

**AFEW SMIPLE FORMS OF ENGLSHIPOEMS**

**简体英文诗**

There are various reasons why people compose poetry. Some poems tell a story or describe a certain image in the readers mind. Others try to convey certain feelings such as joy and sorrow. The distinctive characteristics of poetry often include economical use of words, descriptive and vivid language, integrated imagery, literary devices such as similes and metaphors, and arrangement of words, lines, rhymes, and rhythm. Poets use many different forms of poetry to express themselves. Now we will look at a few of the simpler forms

人们写诗有着各种各样的理由。有些诗是为了叙事，或者说是描述读者心目中的某个形象。而有些诗则是为了传达某种感情，比如喜悦和悲伤。诗歌的显著特点通常包括:用词简洁;语言描述生动、形象; 具备整合的意象:使用明喻和隐喻等文学手法:词、句韵、节奏等编排有序。诗人用许多不同格式的诗来表达自己的情感。现在我们来看看几种格式比较简单的诗。

Some of the first poems a young child learns in English are nursery rhymes. They are usually the traditional poems or folk songs. The language of these rhymes, like Poem A, is to the point but has a storyline. Many children enjoy nursery rhymes because they rhyme, have a strong rhythm, and often repeat the same words. The poems may not make sense and even seem contradictory, but they are easy to learn and recite. By playing with the words in nursery rhymes children learn about language.

孩子们最早学习的英文诗是童谣。它们通常是传统的诗歌或民歌。这些童谣(如诗歌A)的语言简单明了，但带有故事情节。许多孩子喜欢童谣，因为它们押韵，节奏感强，并较多单词重复。童谣不一定有什么意义，甚至(有的)看来自相矛盾，但是它们容易学，也容易背诵。通过童谣中的文字游戏，孩子们学习了语言。

One of the simplest kinds of poem is the "list poem", which contains a list of things, people, ideas, or descriptions that develop a particular theme. List poems have a flexible line length and repeated phrases which give both a pattern and a rhythm to the poem. Some rhyme( like B and C), while others do not.

清单诗是诗歌中最简单的一种，它包含一系列发展特定主题的事物、人物想法或描述。清单诗可长可短，可以重复一些短语，较为灵活，形成固定句型和诗的节奏。有些清单诗有韵脚(如B和C)，但有一些没有。

Another simple form of poem that amateurs can easily write is the cinquain, which is made up of five lines. With these, you can convey a strong picture or a certain mood in just a few words. Look at the example( D)

另外一种业余爱好者容易写的简体诗是由五行组成的，叫做五行诗。用五行诗，你可以用少量的词语传递一幅动人的画面或某一特定的心情。请看例子D。

Haiku is a Japanese form of poetry that consists of 17 syllables. It has a format of three lines, containing 5, 7, and 5 syllables respectively. It is not a traditional form of English poetry, but is very popular with English writers. It is easy to write and, like the cinquain, can give a clear picture and create a special feeling using very few words. The haiku poem( E)on the right is a translation from Japanese, which shows a moment in the life of a delicate butterfly.

俳句诗(Hak)是一种日本诗，由17个音节组成。它是三行格式，分别包含5、7和5个音节。它不属英诗的传统形式，但是在用英语写作的人们中间，这种诗也是很流行的。它容易写，而且像五行诗一样，它可以用最少的词语呈现出幅清晰的画面，表达出一种特殊的感情。右边的徘句诗(E)就是从日文翻译出来的，展示了一只蝴蝶生命中的一个瞬间。

English speakers also enjoy poems from China, those from the Tang Dynasty in particular. A lot of Tang poetry has been translated into English, such as this one(F)

说英语的人也喜欢中国的诗，尤其是唐诗。有许多唐诗被翻译成英文，比如这一首诗(F)。

F

Where she awaits her husband

On and on the river flows.

Never looking back,

Transformed into stone

Day by day upon the mountain top,

wind and ram revolve

Should the traveller return this

stone would utter speech

望夫处，江悠悠，

化为石，不回头。

山头日日风复雨，

行人归来石应语。

**Using Language**

**WIND ON THE HILL**

No one can tell me

Nobody knows

Where the wind comes from

Where the wind goes

It's flying from somewhere

As fast as it can I couldn’t keep up with it,

Not if I ran

But if I stopped holding

The string of my kite.

It would blow with the wind

For a day and a nigl

And then when I found it

Wherever it blew,

I should know that the wind

Had been going there too.

So then I could tell them

Where the wind goes…

But where the wind comes from

Nobody knows.

*AA.Milne*

山上的风

没有人能够告诉我，

也没有人会知道，

风来自哪里，

又将去往哪里。

它从一个地方吹来，

尽它所能，飞快地吹来，

我不能赶上它，

即使我奔跑。

但如果我停下来，

不再紧握我手中的风筝线，

它将被风吹跑。

一天一夜

后来当我发现它，

它吹向任何地方，

我会知道风

也曾经去过那里。

所以当我能告诉他们

风去了哪里……

但是风从哪里来

没有人知道。

*(A·A米尔恩)*

DREAM

Hold fast to dreams,

For if dreams die

Life is a broken-winged bird

That cannot fly.

Hold fast to dreams.

For when dreams go

Life is a barren field

Frozen with snow

*langston Hughes*

梦想

紧紧抓住梦想，

梦想若是消亡

生命就象鸟儿折了翅膀

再也不能飞翔。

紧紧抓住梦想，

梦想若是消丧

生命就像贫瘠的荒野，

雪覆冰封，万物不再生长.

(兰斯顿.体斯)

A MATCH

If love were what the rose is

And I were the leaf.

Our lives would grow together

In sad or singing weather,

Brown fields or flowerful closes

Green pleasure or grey grief:

If love were what the rose is

And I were like the leaf.

*A C Swinburne*

配偶

爱情若是红玫瑰，

我是绿叶永相随

花叶同枝共生长

任凭日晒与风吹，

田园小径均开遍

共担忧伤共喜悦，

爱情若是红玫瑰

我是绿叶永相随

*(AC・斯温伯恩)*

Reading and Writing

**EXPLORING POETRY IN CHINA**

**探寻中国的诗歌**

Poetry plays with sounds, words, and grammar, That makes poetry difficult to write but very interesting to read. Poetry uses colours, feelings, experiences, and images to paint a picture in your mind

诗歌与声音、单词和语法相结合，这使得诗歌很难写，但读起来非常有趣。诗歌用色彩、感情、经验和形象在你的脑海中描绘出一幅幅画面。

In Chinese classical poetry, the form is very important: the correct number of lines and the number of characters in each line. Poetry often follows special patterns of rhythm and rhyme.

在中国古典诗歌中，形式非常重要：正确的行数和每行的字数。诗歌往往遵循特殊的节奏和韵律模式。

However, modern poets began to reject traditional forms and structures for poetry in the 20th century. As a result, most poetry today is written in free verse, with lines of varying length.

然而，现代诗人在20世纪开始抵制传统的诗歌形式和结构。因此，今天大多数诗歌都是用自由诗写的，诗行长短不一。

During the Tang Dynasty, a high point of classical Chinese poetry, poems by Li Bai, Du Fu, and Wang Wei became very popular, Widely known as a genius and often called the "Immortal Poet", Li Bai(701-762) wrote with a romantic style and his poems celebrate things such as friendship, nature, and wine. Du Fu(712-770) is also known as one of the greatest Chinese poets. He has been called the "poet-historian" and the "Poet Sage" by Chinese critics, and his poems cover a range of topics, with his most famous poems reflecting on the effects of war on the people. Wang We (701-761) was a painter, musician, and poet, and he was well known for his love of nature in his paintings and poetry.

中国古典诗歌巅峰时期，唐朝李白,杜甫,和王维诗歌非常受欢迎,广泛被称为天才,通常被称为“不朽的诗人”,李白(701-762年)，他的诗词以浪漫主义风格著称，他的诗词歌颂友谊、自然、酒等。杜甫(712-770)也被称为中国最伟大的诗人之一。他被中国评论家称为 "诗史家 "和 "诗圣"，他的诗涉及的题材广泛，最著名的诗作是反映战争对人民的影响。王维(701-761)是一位画家、音乐家、诗人，他的画作和诗歌以热爱自然而著称。

Outside of Asia, the study of Chinese language introduced the West to Chinese poetry. Americans were first introduced to classical Chinese poetry by American poet Ezra Pound (1885-1973). He translated 18 classical Chinese poems, mainly by Li Bai, into English, based on the notes of the American art historian Ernest Fenollosa (1853-1908). At about the same time, Chinese writers started reading more foreign poetry. From around 1910 onwards, European literature came to China when some famous writers began to translate both poetry and novels into Chinese。

在亚洲之外，汉语的研究让西方人认识了中国的诗歌。美国人最早经由美国诗人埃兹拉-庞德（1885-1973）而接触到中国古典诗词。他根据美国艺术史学家欧内斯特-费诺罗萨（Ernest Fenollosa，1853-1908）的笔记，将18首以李白为主的中国古典诗词翻译成英文。大约在同一时间，中国作家开始更多地阅读外国诗歌。大约从1910年开始，欧洲文学传入中国，一些著名作家开始将诗歌和小说翻译成中文。

Just like readers in the West, Chinese readers admire Shakespeare, John Milton, Alexander Pope and many others for their fine English poetry. English Romantic poets are greatly loved in China. The nature poems by William Wordsworth, *Ode to the West Wind* by Percy Bysshe Shelley, George Gordon Byron's *Isles of Greece*, and long poems by John Keats have long been favourites. The style and the atmosphere in their poems have often led to comparisons with poets such as Du Fu and Li Bai. Among modern poetry, the American poet Robert Frost and his poems might be the best known.

就像西方的读者一样，中国读者欣赏莎士比亚、约翰-弥尔顿、亚历山大-波普等人的优秀英文诗歌。英国浪漫主义诗人在中国深受喜爱。威廉-华兹华斯的自然诗、珀西-拜谢-雪莱的《西风颂》、乔治-戈登-拜伦的《希腊群岛》、约翰-济慈的长诗等，早已成为人们的最爱。他们的诗风和诗中的气氛，常使人与杜甫、李白等诗人相提并论。在现代诗歌中，美国诗人罗伯特-弗罗斯特和他的诗歌可能是最著名的。

Today, many Chinese people are becoming more interested in reading poems, no matter in what language they are written. Translations can be good, but being able to read in the original language is best. No matter how well a poem is translated, something of the spirit of the original work is lost. Besides, poems and literature can be bridges between East and West. They can help us to understand each other better, or as the poet Mu Dan wrote:

*Quietly, we embrace*

*In a world lit up by words.*

如今，很多中国人越来越喜欢读诗，不管是用什么语言写的诗。翻译可以是好的，但能用原文阅读是最好的。无论一首诗翻译得多好，都会失去原作的一些精髓。此外，诗歌和文学可以成为东西方之间的桥梁。它们可以帮助我们更好地理解对方，或者像诗人穆旦写的那样。

*静静地，我们拥抱着*

*在这个被文字点亮的世界里。*
